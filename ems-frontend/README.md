   - Uses Axios for HTTP requests

## Data Flow

1. **Component Initialization**
   - Components mount and initialize state
   - API calls are made to fetch initial data
   - Data is stored in component state

2. **User Interactions**
   - User actions trigger state updates
   - API calls are made to persist changes
   - UI updates reflect new data

3. **Error Handling**
   - API errors are caught and displayed
   - Loading states are managed
   - User feedback is provided

## Styling

- Uses Material-UI for consistent design
- Custom theme configuration in App.js
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Custom styling for specific components

## State Management

- Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks
- Component-level state management
- API service for data fetching and updates

## Error Handling

- API error handling in service layer
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for better UX

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient data fetching
- Optimized re-renders
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Security

- API calls include proper headers
- Input validation on forms
- Error handling for failed requests

## Browser Support

- Supports modern browsers
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow ESLint configuration
   - Use functional components
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Component Structure**
   - Keep components focused and small
   - Use proper prop types
   - Implement proper documentation

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Test API integration
   - Verify error handling

## Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   ```cmd
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Production Considerations**
   - Environment variables
   - API endpoint configuration
   - Error tracking setup

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check API endpoint configuration
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **Build Issues**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall
   - Update dependencies
   - Check for version conflicts
